# Big Help Mob - Community Powered Volunteering Flash Mobs #

Big Help Mob is Youth Tree's latest project currently in development. The idea is simple: Regularly get together 100+ young people from all across the metro area in a big mob and do something useful for a local not-for-profit (tree-planting, renovating homeless shelters etc)... and then celebrate with enormous, ludicrous flash-mobs (100 people looking up at the sky in the CBD for no apparent reason... that sort of thing). (From the original Big Help Mob teaser / intro site)

## About this Application ##

The Big Help Mob web application is a Rails 3 web application, headed by [Darcy Laycock](http://github.com/Sutto) that powers
http://bighelpmob.org/. It's fairly simple for all intents and purposes - even scheduling, signup and a few other things along
those lines. As we grow, it'll expand to include more (e.g. a facebook application aspect)

## Contributing ##

We encourage all community contributions. Keeping this in mind, please follow these general guidelines when contributing:

* Fork the project
* Create a topic branch for what you’re working on (git checkout -b awesome_feature)
* Commit away, push that up (git push your\_remote awesome\_feature)
* Create a new GitHub Issue with the commit, asking for review. Alternatively, send a pull request with details of what you added.
* Once it’s accepted, if you want access to the core repository feel free to ask! Otherwise, you can continue to hack away in your own fork.

Other than that, our guidelines very closely match the GemCutter guidelines [here](http://wiki.github.com/qrush/gemcutter/contribution-guidelines).
