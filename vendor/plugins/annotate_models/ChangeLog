  * Fix bug where we corrupted the PREFIX string and therefore duplicated
    the header
  * No longer include the datetime, so we don't trigger a commit
    back into repos

    -- NOTE -- just this once, you'll get a duplicate header after you run
    a_m on an already-annotated model. Sorry.... Dave
